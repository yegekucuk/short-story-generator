Maya stumbled upon a dusty library in an alley she'd never noticed before. The sign read, "Library of Lost Books." Inside, shelves stretched endlessly, filled with books that didn't exist in the real world. Titles like "The Adventures of a Time-Traveling Teacup" and "Whispers from the Moon." She picked one up, and it told a story she had dreamed of but never written. The librarian smiled and said, "These are stories waiting to be found." Maya visited often, finding tales she never knew she needed. Inspired, she began writing her own. One day, her book appeared on the shelf. The library had found her story, too.
