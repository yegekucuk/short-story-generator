Luna found an antique mirror at a yard sale. It didn't reflect her imageâ€”instead, it showed her dreams. Some were beautiful, others strange. She spent hours watching, mesmerized. One day, she saw a dream of herself doing something brave she'd never tried before. Inspired, she decided to make it real. As she succeeded, the mirror showed her new dreams, filled with endless possibilities. Luna realized the mirror didn't predict her future; it revealed her potential. She no longer needed the mirror to believe in herself. But she kept it as a reminder that dreams can become reality.
