Max had always been a lover of books, but when he discovered the library hidden beneath the city, his passion for reading was taken to a new level. The library was vast—endless shelves filled with books that seemed to stretch into infinity. The librarian, an old man with a gentle smile, welcomed Max and handed him a key. “Every book here is a universe,” the librarian said. “Choose wisely.” Max wandered through the aisles, selecting a book that caught his attention. As soon as he opened it, he was transported into the world within its pages. The experience was unlike any he had ever imagined—he could feel, taste, and touch everything within the book. Each time Max finished a story, he was returned to the library, where he could choose another book. But soon, he realized that some of the books had dark consequences. Reading them caused ripples in the real world, affecting the lives of those around him. Max had to decide whether to continue his exploration of the infinite library or close the door on this limitless adventure. In the end, he chose to leave, knowing that some stories were best left unread.
