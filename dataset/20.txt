James was an unremarkable man with an extraordinary secret. He had discovered time travel through a mysterious device his grandfather left behind. At first, he used it for personal gain, visiting events in history to witness moments he had only read about. But over time, he grew disillusioned. He realized that the smallest change in the past could have catastrophic consequences. James decided to stop meddling with time, but fate had other plans. One day, while traveling to the past, he met a young woman named Ava who was in grave danger. Without thinking, he intervened to save her. When he returned to his present time, everything was different. The world was not as he remembered. Ava had changed the course of history in ways he couldnâ€™t comprehend. Desperate to fix his mistake, James traveled back again, only to find that Ava was now aware of his presence. She had become a time traveler herself. Together, they raced against time to undo the damage they had caused. In the end, James realized that time was not meant to be controlled. Sometimes, the best course of action was to let things unfold naturally.
