Liam woke up on his birthday, expecting surprises. But everyone seemed to have forgotten. No "Happy Birthday" from his family, no party, nothing. Feeling sad, he wandered to the park, where he found a small envelope on a bench. It had his name on it. Inside was a note: "Follow the red balloons." Curious, he did, and they led him to a hidden spot filled with friends, cake, and decorations. It was a surprise party after all! Liam realized sometimes the best surprises come when you least expect them. His forgotten birthday turned out to be the most memorable one.
