Leo found an old jar buried in his backyard. Inside was a rusted key and a note that read, "To the door that isn't there." Confused, he searched his house but found nothing unusual. One night, he noticed a faint outline on his bedroom wall. He pressed the key against it, and a hidden door creaked open. Inside was a small room filled with forgotten treasures. Among them was a picture of his grandfather holding the same key. Leo realized it was his grandfather's secret hideout. The key had unlocked not just a door, but a family mystery. And in that tiny room, Leo found stories that would last a lifetime.
