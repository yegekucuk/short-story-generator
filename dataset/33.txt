Sophie found a notebook with blank pages. But when moonlight hit the paper, words appeared. They weren't random; they answered her thoughts. She realized someone was writing back from another time. Night after night, they shared stories, jokes, and dreams. One evening, the messages stopped. Heartbroken, Sophie found a final note: "Meet me where the stars touch the sea." She went to the beach and found a bottle with a message inside. It simply said, "I'm glad we met." Sophie never learned who wrote the notes, but she carried their words in her heart forever.
