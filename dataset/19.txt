Ollie believed he could catch stars. Every night, he reached for the sky with a jar. Of course, he never caught oneâ€”or so he thought. One morning, he woke to find his jar glowing faintly. Inside was a tiny, flickering light. It wasn't a star, but a piece of his own hope. He realized the stars weren't in the sky; they were inside him all along. From then on, he collected dreams instead of stars. Each jar reminded him of what he was capable of. Ollie never stopped reaching for the sky.
