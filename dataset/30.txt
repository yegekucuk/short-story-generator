Finn loved flying kites. One windy day, his kite soared so high it disappeared into the clouds. Heartbroken, he thought it was lost forever. But the next morning, it floated back down, tied with a note: "Thanks for visiting." From then on, Finn sent messages into the sky with his kite. Sometimes, notes came back. He never knew who sent them, but he didn't mind. Some mysteries are better left floating in the clouds. Finn's kite carried not just dreams, but connections to the unknown. And that made it magical.
