In a war-torn land, a young woman named Elara was known for her incredible healing abilities. But she had a secret: she could heal wounds with her touch, but she never spoke a word. Her silence was as much a part of her as her gift. Elara traveled from village to village, helping those in need, earning the trust of everyone she met. One day, she encountered a soldier who had been gravely injured in battle. Desperate, the soldier begged her to heal him. But Elara could sense that his injuries were not just physical—they were emotional, too. He had lost everything in the war, and his heart was broken. As she touched his wound, she realized that her healing was more than just physical—it could mend the heart as well. With each person she healed, Elara grew stronger, but the toll it took on her began to wear her down. She soon realized that every healing she performed left a piece of her own spirit behind. Elara had to decide whether to continue healing others at the cost of herself or to stop and save what remained of her soul. In the end, she chose to heal one last time, knowing that her silence and sacrifice would be remembered forever.
