In the middle of a forest, Emma found a door standing alone, with no walls around it. It had no handle, no keyhole—just a door. Curious, she pushed, but it wouldn't budge. She knocked, and to her surprise, someone knocked back. A voice whispered, "The door opens with a question, not a key." Emma thought hard and asked, "What lies beyond you?" The door creaked open, revealing a world filled with floating islands and glowing rivers. She realized curiosity was the real key. Emma stepped through, ready for whatever came next. Some doors aren't meant to be locked—just understood.
