Emma always thought her cat, Whiskers, was special. One morning, Whiskers greeted her with, "Good morning, Emma." Shocked but curious, she replied, "You can talk?" Whiskers yawned, "I've always been able to. You just never listened." They spent the day chatting about everythingâ€”Emma's dreams, Whiskers' secret adventures, and why cats love knocking things over. Emma realized Whiskers was her best friend, not just a pet. Over time, talking to Whiskers felt normal. They laughed, shared secrets, and even planned little adventures. Emma learned that sometimes, magic is just about listening. And Whiskers was happy to finally be heard.
