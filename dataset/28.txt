On a remote island, a solitary lighthouse keeper named Thomas lived a quiet, uneventful life. His job was simple: to ensure the light never went out, guiding ships safely to shore. But one stormy night, as the waves crashed violently against the rocks, Thomas noticed something strange in the distance—a ship that was heading directly toward the island. He frantically tried to warn them, but the ship’s lights flickered, and the ship sailed on without heeding the warning. The ship crashed into the rocks, and Thomas rushed to the shore to rescue survivors. Among the wreckage, he found a woman who seemed familiar but could not place where he had seen her before. She had no memory of who she was or how she had arrived. Over the next few days, Thomas cared for her, and they grew close. Yet, something about the woman, named Emma, felt off. One night, as the lighthouse light flickered in the storm, Thomas uncovered an old journal that revealed Emma had died years ago in the same shipwreck. He confronted her, and she confessed to being a ghost, unable to move on. The lighthouse had kept her trapped. Together, they found a way to break the curse, and as the first light of dawn broke, Emma vanished peacefully into the sea. Thomas, now free of his lonely existence, found a new purpose in life.
