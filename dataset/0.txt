Noah discovered an old clock at a flea market. It ticked backward, but strangely, it never needed winding. Curious, he kept it on his desk. Over time, he noticed something oddâ€”when he stared at the clock, memories felt sharper, like he was reliving them. One day, he turned the clock hands all the way back. Suddenly, he was a child again, standing in his old room. At first, it was fun, but he missed the people he'd met since then. Realizing the past was beautiful but the future mattered more, he set the clock forward. Noah returned to the present, cherishing both where he'd been and where he was going.
