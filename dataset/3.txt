Sophie had always been drawn to old antiques, but there was one item she could never resist—the mirror in the attic. It was an ornate, gilded frame, with intricate designs that seemed to shift when she wasn’t looking directly at it. One day, Sophie decided to investigate. As she gazed into the mirror, she saw a reflection of herself, but it wasn’t quite right. Her reflection seemed to move on its own, as if it were a separate entity. Sophie reached out to touch the glass, and in an instant, she was pulled into the mirror. On the other side, she discovered a parallel world, one that mirrored her own but with subtle differences. In this world, she was not who she thought she was. She had a different life, different friends, and a different destiny. Sophie was given the chance to live this new life, but as she tried to adjust, she realized that the mirror world was not as perfect as it seemed. There were dark secrets hidden beneath the surface. Sophie had to find a way to return to her own world before she was trapped forever. With one final push, she escaped the mirror, but the experience left her with a lingering question: had she ever truly left?
