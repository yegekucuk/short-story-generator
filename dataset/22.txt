Beneath the bustling streets of New York, there was a hidden city that no one knew existed. It was a place where the forgotten and the lost lived in peace, far away from the eyes of the world. Leo, an investigative journalist, stumbled upon the entrance by accident. He had been chasing a story when he found a hidden door under a manhole cover. Intrigued, he entered and discovered a world unlike anything he had ever imagined. The people living there were descendants of those who had disappeared, leaving no trace behind. They lived off the grid, building their homes out of materials scavenged from the city above. Leo befriended them, learning that the city was once part of the original New York but was sealed off after a disaster long ago. The inhabitants had no desire to return to the surface, but Leo couldn’t resist. He wanted to tell the world about this hidden society. But the people of the city had their own rules—they never left, and they never wanted to be found. Leo had to choose: expose the city and disrupt their way of life, or keep their secret safe and leave the city behind. He chose silence, returning to the surface and never speaking of what he had discovered.
